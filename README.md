### Requirements
The model is coded using the R programming language. Thus, you will need to [download program R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) to work with the code. We also recommend downloading the free version of [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/), which provides a nice integrated development environment for working with R. 

R consists of many 'packages' developed by R users that bundle-up specific functions for manipulating, analyzing and visualizing data.
